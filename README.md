netstream-viewer-java
=====================

A NetStream Live Graph Viewer written in Java.

This small but handy program creates a live graph display for incoming NetStream [1] events. The underlying graph library is GraphStream [2]. For example, this viewer can be used with NetLogo [3] using the GraphStream NetLogo extension [4].

You can customize the included ```stylesheet.css``` file for your taste. Check the CSS reference for GraphStream [5]. You can adjust settings in the ```viewer.properties``` file such as the network port to use, drawing quality and some graph layout parameters.
